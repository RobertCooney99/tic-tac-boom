# Tic-Tac-Boom

Tic-Tac-Boom is a web-based game created using Node, React, Socket.IO and Express.

## Functionality

This game is an extended version of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe, taking inspiration from Minesweeper.
Players take it in turns placing their respective noughts and crosses, with random chances of
bomb explosions. The explosion can either be a small bomb (wiping out the clicked cell and surrounding
cells), or a big bomb (wiping out the entire board).

Currently there are 3 main game modes in which to play. **Solo vs. Robot**, **Multiplayer (Local)**
and **Multiplayer (Online)**.

## Future Updates

There will also be the option for a player to play locally against a bot, with varying levels
of "difficulty".

Also, there will be a number of different game add-ons to choose from,
such as a timed game mode, increased bombs, and power-ups.
